                                                            I am an Australian born citizen with Argentinien family background, I left school halfway through year 12 to commence a traineeship as a Network Technician with a small local business on Yorke Peninsula, I then moved on from that role due to personal reasons and headed back into the hospitality game, there I was able to travel around Australia and manage different hotels for a number of years. While traveling I had the opportunity to study a number of boating certificates to gain employment in the shipping trade, but that fell short, as I found my beautiful wife who I have been with for 10 years and counting.

                                                            In this section about myself I have added more personal information about me, that I didn’t think to add in my original website. I was born in Adelaide South Australia. My mother was born in the UK she was raised in India, my father was born in Switzerland he was Swiss French, my culture is mainly British despite the cultural diversity. I completed year 11, Cert 2 and 3 in security, Cert 2 in fitness and did a diploma in IT. One of my hobbies is Tarantula keeping. I had kept thirty different species of Australian Tarantulas. I started a group on Facebook for reptile’s invertebrates and amphibians. I have a cat her name is Bella I raised her from a six-week- old kitten. In my spare time I do weight training, cycling, reading and playing sims 3 on pc. I am the youngest of five in my family, my life wasn’t an easy one I was brought up in a very religious strict environment. I broke away from the religious environment which lead to me being disowned. I had to form a new life without family support. I have lived in Sydney and Melbourne, I lived in Sydney for 12 months and I lived in Melbourne for 6 years. I have a partner who lives in Cardiff Wales and I am working towards moving over there after I complete my studies. I have travelled overseas to England, Germany, Amsterdam, Singapore, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Thailand. I leave in four weeks to Wales to see my Fiancé. I reside in Adelaide South Australia; I live in the city itself which is handy for me as I don’t drive. I am one of those people you will see at a local café enjoying a latte perusing social media or reading the paper. Our team name is Meta Tier Solutions we came up with the group name based around our project we decided the name together in a team meeting. We wanted a team name that sounded professional.

                                                            I am a 30-year-old single father from Queensland whose hobbies include writing music, gaming and programming. My interest in IT began at a young age after playing video games and building my first computer, but it didn't truly flourish until my late 20's during my work in a technical role within a CCTV program.
                                                            I believe this passion for IT is the result of a combination of the freedom for creativity it can offer and the ever present and changing problem solving aspect of the industry. The room left for further innovation feels near infinite, the possibility for us to all leave our footprint of humanity is very much available to those of us passionate to pursue a career within Information Technology.
                                                            I have experience working within a government organization contributing to front-end web design and development along with general troubleshooting and maintenance on equipment and software.

                                                            I originally come from Dublin, Ireland and my Irish accent is one of the things people notice about me. My father mentioned I was good at technical things so suggested I look into working with computers. I was one of the first people to have a home pc in my class so was pretty good in computer classes and assisted the teacher with instructing other students. I completed my year 12 equivalent in Ireland and started doing a programming course, but while walking through the local shops, a friend of a friend mentioned he was starting a computer hardware course so I dropped out of programming and did that. This gave me some good opportunities such as being able to travel to Florida for a couple of months as part of study work over there. After the course I got a position working with upgrading the Dublin health service government computers for the incoming Euro currency and Y2k changeover. Though it was a term project, I was able to impress my supervisor that I was asked to come onboard as a helpdesk agent in the IT call centre and while working with this organisation for several years I moved onto lab repair work and then onto fieldwork, driving around to different locations solving issues. I then relocated to Australia, I again got a job working in IT desktop support which I’ve been doing for the last 14 years. I’ve now moved away from the day to day desktop work to a mid-level role supervising the desktop support person, providing backup for the system administrators and working on various projects. I’ve got a curious nature and I’m always looking into new technology and trying to improve my knowledge with new things. I’m also a typical gamer, playing a variety of PC games, Xbox and mobile platform games. As a family man, I encourage my kids to explore and try out new things so they can have a variety of choices as they get older. Although my background is strongly hardware side, I’d like to get back into the programming/coding side of IT work and that’s why I started with Open University/RMIT to see what the next step for me will be.

                                                            My first interest in IT was a young kid playing Doom and Quake. I wondered what made this wonderful machine work the way it did. I'm very interested in networking and hardware; building custom computers is something I enjoy. I;d love to build my own server, but currently lack the funds. I eventually got my own second hand computer and wrecked it within a week. Being a very experimental child, I deleted System32; after all, it was taking up so much space. When I was young, I ended up in foster care several times and one of the best places I ever stayed with was with my primary school IT teacher and his family. The efforts that family went to still blow my mind. I became who I am because of them. My teacher/foster father instilled a love of computers and IT that has lasted my entire life. I don't have much IT experience beyond clearing viruses from friends laptops and building my own PC. I tried to learn programming myself a few years ago, but I struggled with C++ and gave up after a couple months. I chose RMIT because it is well known for being great for IT. I figured I would pick the school with the best reputation for IT that I knew of. To be fair, I never gave it much thought. Somebody on Reddit messaged me when I was struggling and gave me the encouragement to enrol and get started, so I jumped in feet first and now, here we are. I'm hoping to become a competent programmer and learn more about networking, though I expect the total sum of knowledge I acquire to be much greater by the end of my studies. I don't really know exactly what my dream job would be, but I've been leaning more towards becoming a network engineer more than anything else.
