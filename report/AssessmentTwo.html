citizen with Argentinien family background, I left school halfway through year 12 to commence a traineeship as a Network Technician with a small local business on Yorke Peninsula, I then moved on from that role due to personal reasons and headed back into the hospitality game, there I was able to travel around Australia and manage different hotels for a number of years. While traveling I had the opportunity to study a number of boating certificates to gain employment in the shipping trade, but that fell short, as I found my beautiful wife who I have been with for 10 years and counting. </span></p><h3 class="c28" id="h.si30m8xty4yl"><span class="c0">Matt Wilson</span></h3><p class="c13"><span class="c24"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mattwilsonrmit.github.io/S3826711/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578703242408000">https://mattwilsonrmit.github.io/S3826711/index.html</a></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">ID- s3826711 || Meta Tier Solutions &ndash; Frontend DevOps</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">I am a 30-year-old single father from Queensland whose hobbies include writing music, gaming and programming.

I was born in Adelaide South Australia. My mother was born in the UK she was raised in India, my father was born in Switzerland he was Swiss French, my culture is mainly British despite the cultural diversity. I completed year 11, Cert 2 and 3 in security, Cert 2 in fitness and did a diploma in IT. One of my hobbies is Tarantula keeping. I had kept thirty different species of Australian Tarantulas. I started a group on Facebook for reptile&rsquo;s invertebrates and amphibians. I have a cat her name is Bella I raised her from a six-week- old kitten. In my spare time I do weight training, cycling, reading and playing sims 3 on pc. I am the youngest of five in my family, my life wasn&rsquo;t an easy one I was brought up in a very religious strict environment. I broke away from the religious environment which lead to me being disowned. I had to form a new life without family support. I have lived in Sydney and Melbourne, I lived in Sydney for 12 months and I lived in Melbourne for 6 years. I have a partner who lives in Cardiff Wales and I am working towards moving over there after I complete my studies. I have travelled overseas to England, Germany, Amsterdam, Singapore, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Thailand. I leave in four weeks to Wales to see my Fianc&eacute;. I reside in Adelaide South Australia; I live in the city itself which is handy for me as I don&rsquo;t drive. I am one of those people you will see at a local caf&eacute; enjoying a latte perusing social media or reading the paper. Our team name is Meta Tier Solutions we came up with the group name based around our project we decided the name together in a team meeting. We wanted a team name that sounded professional.</span></p><h3 class="c42" id="h.3tsnqhsfl16b"><span class="c0">John Rehill</span></h3><p class="c13"><span class="c69 c81"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3828158.github.io/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578703242411000">https://s3828158.github.io/index.html</a></span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c4">S3828158, Team: Meta Tier Solutions</span></p><p class="c18" id="h.gjdgxs"><span>I originally come from Dublin, Ireland and my Irish accent is one of the things people notice about me. My father mentioned I was good at technical things so suggested I look into working with computers. I was one of the first people to have a home pc in my class so was pretty good in computer classes and assisted the teacher with instructing other students. I completed my year 12 equivalent in Ireland and started doing a programming course, but while walking through the local shops, a friend of a friend mentioned he was starting a computer hardware course so I dropped out of programming and did that. This gave me some good opportunities such as being able to travel to Florida for a couple of months as part of study work over there. After the course I got a position working with upgrading the Dublin health service government computers for the incoming Euro currency and Y2k changeover. Though it was a term project, I was able to impress my supervisor that I was asked to come onboard as a helpdesk agent in the IT call centre and while working with this organisation for several years I moved onto lab repair work and then onto fieldwork, driving around to different locations solving issues. I then relocated to Australia, I again got a job working in IT desktop support which I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last 14 years. I&rsquo;ve now moved away from the day to day desktop work to a mid-level role supervising the desktop support person, providing backup for the system administrators and working on various projects. I&rsquo;ve got a curious nature and I&rsquo;m always looking into new technology and trying to improve my knowledge with new things. I&rsquo;m also a typical gamer, playing a variety of PC games, Xbox and mobile platform games. As a family man, I encourage my kids to explore and try out new things so they can have a variety of choices as they get older. Although my background is strongly hardware side, I&rsquo;d like to get back into the programming/coding side of IT work and that&rsquo;s why I started with Open University/RMIT to see what the next step for me will be.</span></p><h3 class="c42" id="h.s3yxdonmhvdl"><span class="c0">Kyle Hudson</span></h3><p class="c13"><span class="c69"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://khudson-debug979.github.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578703242412000">https://khudson-debug979.github.io/</a></span><span class="c4"><br>Team: Meta Tier Solutions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">My first interest in IT was a young kid playing Doom and Quake. I wondered what made this wonderful machine work the way it did. I&#39;m very interested in networking and hardware; building custom computers is something I enjoy. I;d love to build my own server, but currently lack the funds. I eventually got my own second hand computer and wrecked it within a week. Being a very experimental child, I deleted System32; after all, it was taking up so much space. When I was young, I ended up in foster care several times and one of the best places I ever stayed with was with my primary school IT teacher and his family. The efforts that family went to still blow my mind. I became who I am because of them. My teacher/foster father instilled a love of computers and IT that has lasted my entire life. I don&#39;t have much IT experience beyond clearing viruses from friends laptops and building my own PC. I tried to learn programming myself a few years ago, but I struggled with C++ and gave up after a couple months. I chose RMIT because it is well known for being great for IT. I figured I would pick the school with the best reputation for IT that I knew of. To be fair, I never gave it much thought. Somebody on Reddit messaged me when I was struggling and gave me the encouragement to enrol and get started, so I jumped in feet first and now, here we are. I&#39;m hoping to become a competent programmer and learn more about networking, though I expect the total sum of knowledge I acquire to be much greater by the end of my studies. I don&#39;t really know exactly what my dream job would be, but I&#39;ve been leaning more towards becoming a network engineer more than anything else.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c44 c72" id="h.qugarggor5oy"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c44 c72" id="h.nrx25gkquhgt"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c44" id="h.e8y3r988thv4"><span class="c15">Team Profile </span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c52 c21">-Doug Barrett, Matt Willson</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Doug Barrett Test Results</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Myers-Briggs: INTJ</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Learning Style: Visual Learner</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Big 5 Personality Test: Openness 51, Conscientiousness 40, Extraversion 60, Agreeableness 1, Natural Reactions 87</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="t.4ddb8f843d82ffd23098bf8aea89b4b1c103b929"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c51"><tbody><tr class="c67"><td class="c29" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c34"><span style="overflow: hidden;

A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. Most web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML5. Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small development team. Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side programming. Client refers to a computer application such as a web browser. Client-side programming will typically utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML programming will instruct a browser how to display the on-screen content of web pages, while CSS keeps displayed information in the correct format. JavaScript will run JavaScript code on a web page, making some of the content interactive. Server-side programming powers the client-side programming and is used to create the scripts that web applications use. Scripts can be written in multiple scripting languages such as Ruby, Java and Python. Server-side scripting will create a custom interface for the end-user and will hide the source code that makes up the interface.</span></p><p class="c18" id="h.d6dfdwxbsa60"><span class="c5 c11">(SearchCloudComputing, 2020)</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c23">Network Engineer: </span><span class="c4">focuses on delivering high-availability network infrastructure to sustain the online and on-site information technology activities of users.

Paint.NET has an online forum with a friendly, passionate, and ever-expanding community. Be sure to check out the constantly growing list of tutorials and plugins. Updates are free, and contain new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse. Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, and embossing are included. Also included is our unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included which help you tweak an image&#39;s brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and levels. You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia-toned. Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar colour, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a recolour tool. Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. To accommodate this, every action you perform on an image is recorded in the History window and may be undone. Once you&#39;ve undone an action, you can also redo it.

Currently, within the Safe City Program, he has taken it upon himself to understand SQL along with aspects of Python due to how the Video Monitoring Software (or VMS) has been developed and deployed.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These new found skill sets coupled with his pre-existing knowledge of networking, systems and security enable him to easily move from one task to another, problem solving and troubleshooting, often finding a link between some of the issues that may have been missed if he did not possess an understanding of the various platforms they are developed on.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">His job role simply requires him to install, maintain and educate himself on the latest in CCTV technologies in order to keep the program running and moving forward, though he is constantly trying to innovate himself. With this in mind, Nathan told me &quot;You can&#39;t just go into any aspect of this field with a degree and the ability to just do one or two things. Even if you are hired for one job, you will always find crossover into other areas, like just the other day, the VMS was not allowing the staff to save footage from a single camera, turns out this is because the VMS was finding syntax within camera names like backslashes and trying to create subfolders as a result rather than save footage. At first glance you think it&#39;s one thing like, oh that has to be to do with SQL and maybe the camera ID, but it turns out to be something else entirely and you never would have gotten there without that experience and broad knowledge base to find that root cause.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Nathans work load seems to be extremely diverse when it comes to daily tasks and long term goals being worked on.

As a result, tasks requiring work being performed in the office, are often conducted remotely through Remote Desktop Protocol sessions. This enables Nathan to investigate and sometimes even completely solve issues while out in the field with just his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">mobile phone.

I have produced a few websites for clients as well as my own, and when it comes to deploying those websites and deciding whether to spend money on building my own server and hosting them that way, or go with the cloud I choose the cloud, and in particular I had chosen Amazon Web Services for the simple fact that in today&#39;s world it makes no sense to spend money on hardware and resources when it can be accessed through the cloud.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">What will be different for me?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">My whole business strategy will be changing to accommodate using the cloud and the services it has to offer. Moving all my data onto a reliable and secure server that will have multiple redundant sources if ever one server was to go offline is a great tool for any business which stores a lot of valuable data. With the cost of renting server space and hosting websites and applications from them decreasing, will give me access to a whole new market and bring in additional income.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">How will this affect members of my family or my friends?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With everything becoming online and through the cloud will bring its problems to the older members of my family, as things will get complicated quickly for them as the technology changes, but that being said for the younger generation it will be an amazing experience to see what we will be able to accomplish through the cloud in the near future and just how different the internet will be.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c62" id="h.g2fwcgvwm0qp"><span class="c15">3.Raspberry Pi and Arduino </span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c52 c21">Kyle Hudson</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What does it do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">A Raspberry Pi is a small credit card sized, single board computer designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK. Originally designed to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. It plugs into a computer or monitor to provide display. These days, a Raspberry Pi can be used for almost anything you can imagine. People have made everything from audio devices that can play music from spotify all the way up to building their own laptop or phone with a Pi as the main board. The sky&#39;s the limit really. Wifi enabled robots that can be controlled via a web browser or a game console controller, home security systems and even real time facial recognition systems have been designed and built with a Raspberry Pi. It can utilize a multitude of operating systems, including multiple Linux distros and Windows 10 IoT Core. It ships with its own linux version, called Raspbian. In its current state, a Raspberry Pi is a computer, and is capable of almost anything a computer can do; with a much lower price point. Newer models boast USB 3.0, ethernet connectivity, and the latest mode can even output to a pair of 4k displays simultaneously. Power is delivered via USB-C to the device. In the future, as hardware gets smaller and more powerful, the Raspberry Pi will be capable of even more. Smarter robots, more robust software and more connectivity with the Internet of Things (IoT). It is a fantastic educational device, and demand is growing for this exciting product. Schools, hobbyists and hospitals have all shown interest over the years. The next model may even be fast enough to replace your basic desktop pc, but memory and storage is still an issue. Arduino is similar to Raspberry Pi in that it is a very small, single board computer with a lot of capability. Arduino boards can read inputs like a button being pressed or light on a sensor and turn that into an output, like a written message, a blinking LED light or even activating a program to post a tweet for instance. They are cheap, and like the Raspberry Pi, it was originally aimed at students with no prior knowledge to be used as a learning device. Everything from a blinking LED light to complex scientific instruments have been created using Arduino boards as the brain of the device. In the future, Arduino hopes to become a much bigger part of the IoT and with a partnership with Intel on the horizon, its cheap prototyping capabilities are going to be even more useful and accessible. An example I&#39;ve seen was Arduino based home electronics that will allow the user to control the device&#39;s functionality in new ways; changing how their microwave heats their food for instance. With easier prototyping, and the modularity of the Arduino, upgrading home electronics or creating your own systems will become much simpler. Some people have already connected an Arduino board to a Raspberry Pi to take advantage of the functionality of both devices to receive inputs from the Arduino and output the results or program to the Raspberry Pi. I can see this functionality getting much better in the next few years as engineers, students and hobbyists keep pushing the limits of these devices. All of this is only possible with the rise of incredibly cheap, and tiny pieces of hardware that are only getting easier and cheaper to produce. These amazing devices have grown exponentially over the last 5 years and now sell millions of units per year, further funding development to improve and upgrade the hardware.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What is the likely impact?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The impact of these devices can not be understated. While both were originally designed as learning tools for students with little to no experience, the modularity of the devices and ability to execute many custom programs has drawn interest from many other sectors, including restaurants, hospitals, government bodies and universities. These devices will be the brains of the next generation of IoT devices, and as such will become a part of many people&#39;s daily lives. Having cheaper, easily upgradeable hardware could make ordering food at a restaurant as simple as using a touchscreen menu and having the chef directly receive your order. As automation becomes more commonplace, there will be less face to face interaction and more simple computer systems running everything from the lights in a restaurant, to keeping track of a hospital patients treatment records. As these devices get cheaper and more powerful, and more people with experience decide to go into teaching as a career, expect these devices to be everywhere; classrooms, homes, schools, hospitals and businesses are all in a great position to take advantage of the this technology. The Internet of Things keeps growing, and these simple, powerful devices are leading the way to an interesting new world of automation and computing.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These devices could make many simple, easily programmable jobs completely redundant, which has always been a concern of automation critics. We see this already, with places like McDonalds taking most in store orders through automated systems that require no employee interaction. Automation isn&#39;t to be feared though, society is changing, and we as humans need to change and adapt with it, or be left in the past. Something to be concerned about is our digital privacy, and data protection. While these devices can be used to protect you, they are also another potential entry point for malicious users to attempt to subvert our systems and steal our data.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">How will this affect me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These devices could have a multitude of effects on me. As someone interested in emerging</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">technologies, I want to see how I can use devices like this in my own life; whether I want to embark on various Raspberry Pi projects to connect to the Internet of Things all the way to building my daughter a simple word processing laptops. Many of my friends and family will be affected by this technology as well. Jobs may become obsolete, or easier. Keeping our homes and private data secure is becoming increasingly difficult, and these devices can either help or harm our attempts at digital privacy.Several people in my family use simple electronics in their work, and these cheap devices could make their jobs easier to manage, while raising productivity. Having a fully connected home can make simple daily tasks simpler or easier to keep track of, but a power outage or an internet connectivity issue could see us losing control of our homes. With everyone in the modern world is becoming more interested in the power of home computing and connectivity, education about these devices and necessary security when going online is more important than ever. With a home connected and run by these devices, the risk of personal and private information being stolen by nefarious parties becomes even more likely. But these devices can also help secure our information, using programs and firewalls outside of our usual computer based protections. Digital privacy should be everyone&#39;s concern in this day and age, And these devices are both a boon and a menace when it comes that protecting ourselves online.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c44 c72" id="h.gebnqwsmnrmt"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c62" id="h.cbgjx2us15qw"><span class="c15">4.Machine Learning</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c52 c21">John Rehill</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What does it do? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Machine Learning as a basic concept is the process in which a machine can analyze a set of data and from this dataset can evaluate and predict possible outcomes of this data. With traditional uses of computers and machines, specific instructions would be written for a task and the machine or device would perform that task as preprogrammed. Deviation from the preprogrammed path was not possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This would later evolve into the IFTTT, or &lsquo;If This Then That&rsquo;, model. A machine would not only be given a set of instructions to perform but an additional set of instructions could be included that would either supplement or replace the first set of instructions based on conditions such as environmental factors or other known elements or scenarios.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Over time the concept evolved that rather than have a programmer or user predict such issues or possible paths and then develop a long list of subroutines to the primary one, the machine would be able to understand at what point a change would need to be made and differ from its main programming. This became the basis of artificial intelligence, the process of a machine thinking like a human. However, the ability of a machine to do calculations given a wide variety of data and possible outcomes much quicker and easier is quickly apparent. The time taken for a human to gather data, collate it into an understandable and useable format, process the possible outcomes and produce a likely outcome can be vastly reduced by using a machine to process the data. In most cases, this would be easier as the data itself when collected is in a machine structured format so rather than the information being converted, it could be used as-is. Also, the machine can retain much more information and recall information more quickly than a human can.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Machine Learning used to be a concept that could only be used on large mainframes of systems by organisations that can access data and process it. The collection of data was done remotely and then transported to the mainframes to begin the analysis. However, with the evolution of technology, the concept of Machine Learning is now developed to the point that home consumer devices such as cars and mobile devices such as phones can include the technology that allows them to do the processing in the local state and only need to upload the data to a larger mainframe when required. This type of predictive behaviour is not only limited to physical devices but also used for services such as online streaming content. As a user watches a show or a collection of movies the data from this viewership is collated and based on this information, predictive analysis can determine what other content that can be viewed would appeal to the user and therefore specific content can be targeted to the person. This increases the value of such a service to the consumer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">As technology continues to evolve, and with more and more data being retained for later analysis, Machine Learning can be applied not only for an end-user consumer benefit but also for such things as ecological impact, environmental predictive analysis such as earthquakes and volcano eruptions and weather prediction. Machine Learning is also being turned towards such concepts as political voting outcomes and other sociological events.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">What has made technology such as this possible is the development of large-capacity storage, software to organise such data and the ability to quickly transfer data as required from one information silo to another for better-refined investigation.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What is the likely impact?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">There are many occasions where Machine Learning can be used for both the positive and negative impact of humankind. For example, the analysis of earthquakes in the past and what factors such as minute tremor detections that proceed the main event would enable scientists to better predict when an earthquake may occur. It would also enable them to predict what the actual impact of an earthquake may be on a location not only from and environmental impact with animals that may live there and physical location details but also what the financial impact of such a disaster would be. This would extend to the development of improved manufacturing materials and designs for buildings in this area, the better coordination of relief efforts and the better prediction of global economic impact. This can also be true for weather prediction. By gathering data on previous weather patterns, and an analysis of this, more refined and accurate predictions can be made. This would impact on the long-term planning for such things as farming efforts and transport patterns such as plane and boat travel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The opposite is also true for such things as political voting outcomes. With a detailed look of previous voting records and the various issues that come up for discussion in debates, political candidates can better tailor their response platform to appeal to a voting demographic in order to secure an election win or in the case of dictatorships, to isolate possible threats to an established regime and work to eliminate it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The use of Machine Learning in this way could be seen as a negative as there may become the case that access to a valuable data resource would be only possible to certain individuals or organisations and the ability to use the data effectively for analysis may be restricted by financial aspects.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">How will this affect you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The possibilities used by Machine Learning is not something that probably can be quantifiably felt by a single person as yet, due to the vast nature of the processing required. For example, Machine Learning is currently being applied to the development of self-driving cars. The ability for a machine such as a car to react and thing like a human is still bound by current restrictions placed on it by, in some cases, illogical humans. Some laws govern how a car should be driven on the road but there is an element of common sense or selfish sense when it comes to driving. After a long hard day at work, it would be good to just get in a car and have it drive home however there may be instances, where junctions will not be crossed as the data for that area, indicates a high crash rate due to careless driving so the car may be more cautious. Where Machine Learning is starting to be used more is with the processing of pictures taken with camera phones. With the more expansive modern phones, several images will be taken and the device will be processing them to analyse ones where there is less blurring, someone has their eyes closed etc. and will then present the most appealing to the user. I enjoy playing computer games as a few of the group members do and one aspect where Machine Learning will come into play is to detect the skill aspect of the gamer and to adjust the game to account for that. This means that the replay value of a game goes up as the machine will change behaviour based on previous gameplay, increasing or decreasing the challenge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Another aspect where Machine Learning would be more relevant in my daily life would be with streaming services. As I watch shows and movies and my family does, the service will show more akin shows and movies. This will provide a more enjoyable experience when using the service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><h1 class="c60" id="h.rir3bxxtc0c"><span class="c32 c43">Project Idea</span></h1><p class="c13"><span class="c52 c21">Matt Willson</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21 c52"></span></p><p class="c13"><span>The proposed project was for a functional web application that functions similarly to &ldquo;Dinnerly&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hello Fresh&rdquo; pre-prepared food delivery service except it is entirely online and </span><span class="c4">is looking to lead an untapped industry into a consumer focused means of convenient and affordable eating and living.</span></p><h3 class="c28" id="h.ebxowxkqqjwg"><span class="c0">What Is Meta Foods? &nbsp; A Quick Overview.</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&quot;A focus on more than just food&quot; is what META Foods is all about. Today, more than ever we are scraping for more minutes in the day after work and before bed to spend more time with our families and decompress. While many of us, myself included, find cooking very relaxing and fulfilling, often it is the last thing we want to do at the end of what was potentially a long day. This feeling of &quot;I have to cook tonight&quot; is no doubt heightened when it&#39;s a mammoth task to find something everyone in your house will not only eat, but will nourish and sustain them.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This is where META Foods comes into the picture, providing everyone from all walks of life a means of easily having affordable, delicious and healthy meals every night of the week.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The cooking is still up to you (we aren&#39;t quite there yet) but we have taken care of doing all of the thinking for you when it comes to meeting your entire families dietary requirements, health goals and taking grocery shopping out of the equation while still supporting your local supermarkets.</span></p><h3 class="c28" id="h.c9frdiifla4a"><span class="c0">The Who And The Why. &nbsp;Our Motivation.</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">We are all fathers, brothers or sons and some of us have fairly strict dietary requirements and a desire to try and eat healthy along with family members or friends who potentially need a large variety of different foods to help their growth and development. We believe there is a gap in the market where convenient, affordable and accessible meals are concerned.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">When it comes to easily meeting the &quot;food needs&quot; of a family or yourself this is especially true with busy lives involving work, hobbies and family. Services like &quot;Hello Fresh&quot; and &quot;Dinnerly&quot; seek to streamline the process of finding a recipe, grocery shopping, food preparation and cooking. They do succeed with making this easier but they do not allow for a lot of variations to meet different needs within a single order and (at least for me personally) these are not financially lucrative for a whole family.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This application seeks to take food from an idea to your plate using local super markets and good old fashioned family cooking combined with industry knowledge to bring you something affordable, delicious and healthy that you have tailor made for your situation.</span></p><h3 class="c28" id="h.5yohvykjffoe"><span class="c0">The How And The Now. &nbsp;A Description.</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Imagine you are about to go grocery shopping, but you have no idea where to even start because your partner cannot eat gluten and requires iron-rich meals, your eldest is vegetarian and lactose intolerant and you are trying to cut back on carbs while attempting to cater for everyone else&rsquo;s needs and still enjoy your food. The first and most obvious thought is that you will need to shop for three people individually.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This application will endeavour to allow users to easily generate recipes and meal plans for any number of days based on dietary requirements, weight goals and gym goals. The GUI will essentially provide a means to use specific filters (most are briefly mentioned below) to provide the user with a list of recipes, all with methods and cooking instructions that will allow for the creation of meals and snacks. All of this will be done from the ease of any computer or smart device as META Foods has been developed as a web-based application allowing ease of access and focusing on a user centred design philosophy.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12"></span></p><h1 class="c60" id="h.k5xqmyjleaxy"><span class="c32 c43">Group Reflection</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.ovnt6ljyhrou"><span>Kyle Hudson</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What went well</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;As a group we were able to quickly decide on a team leader and a project idea for us all to focus on, giving us more time to actually complete the project. With a focused team that was well lead, we were in a great position to succeed, and it showed with how quickly we were able to come together and get things done.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What could be improved </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Communication in some cases was lacking, but Douglas made a very effective team leader, which allowed us to overcome the minor communication issues presented by a minority of group members. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It was surprising just how quickly we rallied together to get this project done quickly with as many people as possible involved. Our team&#39;s ability to overcome minor issues was extremely helpful and made the project run smoothly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">One of the things I have learned about working in groups is the difficulties that can be imposed by members personal lives and the problems caused by lack of communication. In the real world, lack of communication can cause severe and expensive setbacks to projects with a deadline that needs to be met.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.b3je7kdwtgln"><span class="c0">John Rehill</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What went well</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I had joined the group early one during the coursework but since collaboration at this stage was not required, I hadn&rsquo;t reached out to group members and they didn&rsquo;t realise I was a member of the group until the group activity had begun. However, once I reached out to the group members, they immediately took me on board with no issues and we&rsquo;re all very friendly. This made it very easy to get over any nervousness about not being part of the initial work. Everyone was very clear and when each person was working on and each member was ready to put their hand up for tasks to do or to offer support to team members.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What could be improved </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Due to the online nature of the group, everyone had to deal with online communication rather than face to face or getting everyone in one room at the same time. Everyone was very understanding if someone had to leave a team member or couldn&rsquo;t make it but when working on a project it&rsquo;s better if the team could be near each other. However, with this course setup, that is not possible so it&rsquo;s not a fault of the team, it&rsquo;s just an observation, the team worked around this issue. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Everyone seemed to have a &lsquo;can do&rsquo; attitude and was ready to get to work. There also seemed to be a natural slot for group members with one person sliding into the leadership role and that made the rest of the team realise that he could be an effective leader and throughout the project, he led quite well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I am more used to dealing with a team project although I am fond of the tools presented to groups to be able to work remotely which each other. This became highly apparent and there are now some tools that I previously only used for myself or for one to one interaction but I can now see the benefit of using them with group projects.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.jjw5vekufhf2"><span class="c0">Sean Cullen</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What went well &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">As a team we work very well together, we all chose Douglas to be team leader for the group. Douglas has made a very good team leader; he has all the right skills to fulfil this role. We as a group just naturally gravitated towards him for help or advice. What went well was how we pulled together as a team, there were no arguments we just did what was assigned to us. Team members committed to their assigned tasks and completed them within a reasonable timeframe. I also found what went well was how everyone managed to stay focused during the holiday period. It is easy to lose that momentum after a holiday. We managed to keep the work flowing through the holiday period. We also kept up communication during this assignment through discord and we had team meetings which went well because everyone was there, we could communicate concerns, take note on where we are at and discuss how we are working as a team.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What could be improved </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The communication could be improved, sometimes it was lacking a couple of team members, but Douglas as a good team leader resolved these issues by means of conflict resolution. Apart from those things we worked well as a team we flowed smoothly together. </span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">What surprised me was how we came together as a team when it needed. I had experience working in a team environment and at first, I was a bit worried about how we would work as a team. But to my surprise we rallied together to get tasks done.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">One of the things I have learned about working in groups is how one person&rsquo;s actions affect us all. For example, if one person is delayed in submitting a task then it affects the flow of everybody&rsquo;s workload, as somebody else must take on the extra task. Also, how if a member of the team doesn&rsquo;t communicate at all it leaves you in question on how to tackle an assignment or task. For example, they might not like certain ideas the group has but the rest of the team won&rsquo;t know unless they communicate within the group, which makes it very difficult.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group&rsquo;s work on this assignment?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Our GitHub log of activity we updated regularly with what we did or changed. We would push n pull the files to Douglas then he would have a look at it and initiate the final commit. We have a chain of command so there weren&rsquo;t final commits done without others knowing. Doug and Matt had the authority to do the commits the rest of us pushed the files through n merged. GitHub reflects our groups work activity quite well we are able to see through this by pulling the file and looking at what was done &nbsp;and we could see what needed to be done, it is very handy if we aren&rsquo;t on at the same time. Doug did a lot of work on the repository setting it up and pushing and pulling of files, we only pushed through files that were completed, prior to pushing through we would all have a look at what was done to make sure everyone was happy then we would push it through. It saves the amount of times we need to push n pull which takes valuable time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.1tvrvxbsn1tv"><span class="c0">Doug Barrett</span></h3><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What went well </span></p><p class="c2"><span>From the start of week two we had a group selected and ready to go bar two, where one dropped out of contact, the other was put in a different group due to not assigning himself to ours via canvas, from that we received a new team member that has fit in really well with our group. We have all really bounded together</span><span class="c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">well, there has been no arguments everyone has pulled their weight even when there has been some really difficult personal situations come up.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What could be improved </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">There is not much I would change except for better communication, it&rsquo;s not that it was lacking its just that I think this whole online group project was a very new experience for a lot of us, and getting used to communicating via chat logs for most of the time can get very tedious and confusing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">One thing that was surprising was how well the lot of us fit in with each other and if we really where a team outside of studying, I think we would be very successful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</span></p><p class="c2"><span>One thing that I have learned about working in groups and especially being a team leader is how satisfying it can be helping other people. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.skah5it9oxp7"><span class="c0">Matt Wilson</span></h3><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What went well &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">We all seemed to fall into roles within the group that fit our personalities and strengths and without argument. Doug really took charge of things answering any questions we may have had, Sean really did an excellent job of keeping everyone on track almost like an assistant team leader, John did an amazing job contributing even though there was a huge misunderstanding with him being added to the team, Kyle also made incredible contributions despite his personal circumstances restricting the time he could interact with us.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">What could be improved </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Honestly, this is a hard one for me. Everything that went wrong we seemed to be dealt with. You could say communication needs to be improved except that it was actively worked on throughout the process.</span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">We all seemed to have some pretty serious personal issues and speed bumps outside of this online world and everyone came together as an actual team. This was surprising because I was not expecting to find this level of comradery. The guys were truly there for each other giving real emotional support for real world problems, some even providing financial support. </span></p><p class="c2 c25"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I was honestly anxious about my assignment results being in the hands of others and as a result, apprehensive about group work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This team really showed me that have a group who are behind each other and committed to everyone getting good results, there is significantly less pressure on you as an individual. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">While this may seem obvious looking in, I was only looking at this from a negative perspective, this team really changed that for me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c70" id="h.jwazu7g3r98m"><span>Group as a Whole</span></h3><p class="c26"><span class="c9">What went well</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">Despite communication issues, despite team members moving house or dealing with financial difficulties, we pulled together well. Doug was an excellent team leader, and he made sure everyone in the group knew what their task was. We chose early on to elect a team leader, and his natural charisma and drive to lead us to success paved the way for us to do well. With one team member leaving and another joining us a bit late, we would expect some difficulties, but every challenge was met and overcome. Our workflow ran extremely smoothly, allowing us to focus on the project and deliver it on time.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9">What could be improved</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">Communication issues were something that we all had to deal with. Some members weren&#39;t always available, and it did create some strain. It was very easy for us to overcome these challenges with Doug leading the way. We honestly don&#39;t know how else to improve, as we rolled right over every challenge in our path. We believe communication was our one big issue, and it still couldn&#39;t prevent us from working well together and getting the project completed.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9">At least one thing that was surprising</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">The biggest surprise was how well we came together to complete this project. We didn&#39;t just see each other as classmates, but very quickly became friends. There was everything from emotional to financial support and it was very obvious that we were in this together. The attitude of our team members was excellent, despite the setback of a team member having to drop the course suddenly and another not actually being in our group due to not joining the group on Canvas.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9">At least one thing that we learned about groups</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">The first thing we learned about working in groups is that group work isn&#39;t as bad or stressful as many of us thought it would be. After all having your grades in someone else&#39;s hands can be daunting. Though group work does have it&#39;s issues; waiting on team members to deliver on promised work was a struggle, as the rest of the team is wondering if they&#39;re going to be doing that task tomorrow instead. Many of us didn&#39;t realise how useful some of these workflow management tools could be, and had previously ignored them. We won&#39;t make that mistake again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c60 c71" id="h.krlhw7wk2ebz"><span class="c32 c43"></span></h1><h1 class="c60" id="h.9tiyeeeznirb"><span class="c32 c43">References</span></h1><ol class="c73 lst-kix_sl7tbyxbt6fa-0 start" start="1"><li class="c18 c30"><span class="c5">Anon, (2020).
