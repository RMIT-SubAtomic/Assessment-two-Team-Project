\tab\b0 I am an Australian born citizen with Argentinien family background, I left school halfway through year 12 to commence a traineeship as a Network Technician with a small local business on Yorke Peninsula, I then moved on from that role due to personal reasons and headed back into the hospitality game, there I was able to travel around Australia and manage different hotels for a number of years. While traveling I had the opportunity to study a number of boating certificates to gain employment in the shipping trade, but that fell short, as I found my beautiful wife who I have been with for 10 years and counting. \par

\b Compare and Contrast the Ideal Jobs for Each Person in the Group\par
\b0 There is a variety of roles within the group which some are the same and some are different. Matt and I being Sean want to do Web Application Development. Doug\rquote s ideal job is Cyber Security, Johns is Software Development and Kyles is Network Engineer. The common elements between Cyber Security, Software Development, Network Engineering and Web Application Development all use programming and require analytical skills. Network engineers also need programming skills to use the new tools and the new programmatic access. But the requirements of network engineering and the job market are now requiring more network engineers with programming skills and a broader and deeper understanding of programming along with analytical skills.\f1  \par

\b Software development:\b0  is an iterative logical process that aims to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a unique business or personal objective, goal or process. Software development is generally a planned initiative that consists of various steps or stages that result in the creation of operational software. Software development is primarily achieved through computer programming, which is carried out by a software programmer and includes processes such as initial research, data flow design, process flow design, flow charts, technical documentation, software testing, debugging and other software architecture techniques. This is known as the software development life cycle (SDLC).\f1  \par

\b Web Application Development:\b0\f1  \f0 Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the user\rquote s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. Most web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML5. Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small development team. Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side programming. Client refers to a computer application such as a web browser. Client-side programming will typically utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML programming will instruct a browser how to display the on-screen content of web pages, while CSS keeps displayed information in the correct format. JavaScript will run JavaScript code on a web page, making some of the content interactive. Server-side programming powers the client-side programming and is used to create the scripts that web applications use. Scripts can be written in multiple scripting languages such as Ruby, Java and Python. Server-side scripting will create a custom interface for the end-user and will hide the source code that makes up the interface.\par

\b Network Engineer: \b0 focuses on delivering high-availability network infrastructure to sustain the online and on-site information technology activities of users. Network engineers often overlap with other roles, such as computer network architects or security systems engineers, and work internally within an organization or as outside consultants. Network engineers design and implement network configurations, troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and configure security systems such as firewalls. They often report to a CIO, chief information security officer and other line-of-business leaders to discuss and decide upon overall business goals, policies and network status updates. In many situations, network engineers work closely with project managers and other engineers, manage capacity and carry out remote or on-site support.\par

\cf7 Version control enables developers to safely through branching and merging. version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code called the repository. The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project. Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official. All these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.\par

\cf7\b Paint.net\par
\b0 Simple, intuitive, and innovative user interface\par
Every feature and user interface element was designed to be immediately intuitive and quickly learnable without assistance. In order to handle multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast. The interface is enhanced for Aero Glass if you are using Windows 7. Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click. Usually only found on expensive or complicated professional software, layers form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form one image. Paint.NET has an online forum with a friendly, passionate, and ever-expanding community. Be sure to check out the constantly growing list of tutorials and plugins. Updates are free, and contain new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse. Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, and embossing are included. Also included is our unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included which help you tweak an image's brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and levels. You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia-toned. Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar colour, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a recolour tool. Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. To accommodate this, every action you perform on an image is recorded in the History window and may be undone. Once you've undone an action, you can also redo it. The length of the history is only limited by available disk space. \par

\b Cyber Security\par
\b0 Due to the shortfall in the demand and supply of cyber security professionals, companies are going above and beyond to acquire the best talent in the cyber security sector and reward them accordingly. This space is going to see an exorbitant growth in the next 5 years, and demand for professionals in this sector will continue to rise. Here are some reasons why your decision to choose a career in cyber security will be secure and profitable: Job Security: According to recent stats, the global shortage of cyber security professionals is going to reach 3.5 million by the end of 2021. There is no doubt that the career outlook for cyber security students is going to be very bright with many opportunities available. Salary Raise: Due to the unique high demand skillset the cyber security professionals offer to the industry, salaries are never a constraint. A cyber security professional in Australia will earn an average salary of $75k \f2\endash\f0  $120k per annum and is expected to increase. Choice of Industry: Today, almost all industries are demanding cyber security professionals. Those who have expertise in this area can choose from a wide range of industries to work in. Due to the increase in demand, Australia is facing a severe skills shortage in the cyber security sector. This shortage is responsible for more than $400 million in revenue and wages lost. Australia is currently short of 2300 workers in cyber security, with an expected demand of at least 17,600 additional professionals in the sector by 2026. Businesses are looking for professionals with a combination of technical skills with expertise in data security along with the understanding of business risk. Because of the unique skills cyber security professionals possess, companies are willing to pay higher salaries to these professionals.\par

\b Network Engineer\par
\b0 The growth of about six percent is expected in the employment of network engineers, from 2016 to 2026. The demand for network engineers has increased over the last decade as companies have expanded their IT networks. Designing new networks or upgrading current ones will continue to create new opportunities for network engineers. Additionally, the increase in healthcare information technology will further add to network engineering opportunities. Overall, the employment outlook for new network engineers is very favourable. Jobs in the field outnumber candidates, keeping the unemployment rate for network engineers around zero. One of the biggest reasons that there is a shortage of workers in the network engineering field is that organizations are looking for highly qualified, educated, and experienced IT professionals.

Employment of web developers is projected to grow 13 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand will be driven by the growing popularity of mobile devices and ecommerce.\f1  \par

Researching about Cyber Security this is an area that is worth pursuing as a career in IT. The rising threat of cybercrime has led to an exponential growth in the Cyber Security Industry. \ldblquote The global cyber security market was worth US$74.5 billion in 2015, and it\rquote s estimated it will be worth close to US$170 billion by 2020\rdblquote . The federal government of Australia has plans of investing over $230 million dollars into the cyber security sector in the next four years. Cyber security as a field has become a new opportunity for Australian businesses. Industries, researchers and government will come together to create enterprises to develop new products and services that will allow small- and large-scale companies to work securely in a connected world.\cf9\f3  \f0 After the growing concerns in the number of data breaches, the Australian government has passed a few data protection regulations that have caused a steep rise in the demand for cyber security professionals across the country. Due to the increase in demand, Australia is facing a severe skills shortage in the cyber security sector. This shortage is responsible for more than $400 million in revenue and wages lost. Australia is currently short of 2300 workers in cyber security, with an expected demand of at least 17,600 additional professionals in the sector by 2026. Businesses are looking for professionals with a combination of technical skills with expertise in data security along with the understanding of business risk. Because of the unique skills cyber security professionals possess, companies are willing to higher salaries to these professionals.\cf2\f1  {\f0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul https}}}}{\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul ://}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul www}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul .}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul institutedata}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul .}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul com}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul /}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul blog}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul /}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul is}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul cyber}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul security}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul in}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul demand}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul in}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul -}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul australia}}}}{\cf2\ulnone\f0\fs22{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.institutedata.com/blog/is-cyber-security-in-demand-in-australia/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf6\ul /}}}}\f0\fs22\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj\b\fs22 What Does it Do?\par
\b0 The tools and roles of a cyber security specialist are vast and can cover all sorts of areas ranging from security administrator, cryptographer, penetration tester, chief information security officer, forensic expert, source code analyzer, and an incident responder to name just a few roles, then \cf10 The technologies involved in this area are state of the art and are ever evolving to fit the needs of the end user, if we look at the Linux OS called Kali for instance, this is a dedicated operating system that can be run straight off a USB drive that is designed just for penetration testers and network security analysts, then if we look at password cracking where people \cf11 should be familiar with a hacking method known as a \ldblquote brute force attack,\rdblquote  which relies on sequential guessing of all possible combinations of a character set in order to beat a password where that password might be protecting something as innocuous as someone\rquote s email or as important as database-level access to credit card data, so with NVidia releasing an SDK  to make the GPUs programmable that then pushed the capabilities to new heights giving even home users the ability to crack passwords.\b [#2] \b0 There are tools that can scan an entire network and report on the \cf10\highlight12\fs20 vulnerabilities, host discovery, what operating systems are installed,  finding open ports, and general firewall probing to see what can go through and what can't. This is all done by a single program called Nmap. \fs22 Metasploit is another technology that is used throughout the cyber security realm, it is a tool in which a pen tester can load and inject known \fs20 vulnerabilities or custom source code into a network to then test it for weak spots\cf2\highlight0\fs22 .\line Cybersecurity is a fast growing field due to more and more things getting connected by what's now called the internet of things or IoT for short. If we take the role of a security specialist they would be\cf10  tasked with protecting computers, networks, software, data or information systems against viruses, worms, spyware, malware, intrusion detection, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and an ever increasing list of attacks by hackers \b [1#] \b0 while using tools and technology to defend against it all\b .\highlight12\b0\fs20\line In the next few years there will be a huge jump in advancement of AI for cybersecurity technologies, what they will have to defend against, for example will be a huge range of new things like AI-bots that will pose a huge danger to online privacy, if that technology is used than computer driven AI chatbots can be used to social engineer vast amounts of people. They might start by using text messages but in the future they could use human speech bots to get users to click on malicious links or download files that would infect their systems and the victims would have no idea that they are talking to a computer, they would think that they are just talking to a person that they might know, or a family member. Another change that will come about in the next few years will be the advancement of quantum computing, that in itself will be a major change in the way cyber security will be approached. Everything will have to be changed to adapt to the massive processing power a quantum machine will be able to perform.\cf11\highlight0\fs22\par
\cf2\b\par
What is the Likely Impact?\par
\b0 What is the potential impact of this development?\line There will be drastic changes in the way people will conduct themselves online with cybersecurity becoming a more mainstream topic. People already have started taking an interest in better password practices by using longer and more complicated passwords and also using password managers, more people have been opting out of a lot of software and internet services that tracks your presence online. People have been using better antivirus and firewall technology, VPN services have become a normal part of everyday internet usage, even encryption technology has become a major part of daily internet usage.\par
What is likely to change?\line Everything will change when it comes to cybersecurity, as encryption gets broken there will be new standards that will arise out of that and be adopted by everyone, there will be major data breaches,  either from a nation state attack or from an individual attacker, but wherever it comes from will cause people to look at how it was caused and change their practices to suite. Technology will become more advanced and from those advancements will spring new forms of attacks and \cf10\highlight12 vulnerabilities for cyber security administrators, penetration testers or \cf2\highlight0 forensic experts\cf10\highlight12  to tackle.\line Which people will be most affected and how?\line\cf2\highlight0 Security administrators, cryptographers, penetration testers, forensic experts, source code analyzers basically the whole field in cyber security will be the most affected, as they will have to learn and keep up with all the changes that will take place as the technology advances. There will also be a lot of victims due to weakness and \cf10\highlight12 vulnerabilities found in systems causing loss of personal data, identify theft as well as financial thief, then there are people's privacy rights that will get affected as governments and big tech become more advanced in monitoring and harvesting data on people.\par
\fs20\par
\cf2\highlight0\b\fs22 How Will This Affect You?\par
\b0 As a small business owner in the IT sector changes in the cyber security sector will affect my job immensely, whether it be in the form of making sure my own website is secure and free of any hidden malicious code that could affect any customers using my online payment services, installing software on new computers that I would build for clients in order to keep them safe while browsing the internet at home, all this in turn might increase my overheads then that will ultimately be passed down to the customer costing them more for my services.\line What will be different for me?\line Depending on how things turn out in the near future in regards to laws being past that will jeopardize my online rights to privacy, or it be a new technology emerging that will break the fundamental laws of encryption, that mainly being quantum computers then nothing much will change for me as I am one to keep up with the weekly threat reports, the occasional data breach that exposes a fundamental flaw in some widely used system.\par
How will this affect members of your family or my friends?\line Threats to cybersecurity will always be a challenge to my family as having three children I can not stress enough how important it is at home to be aware of any threats or even online harassment to my children, and I fear it is only going to become worse as time progresses and more and more of life's aspects become online dependent.\par

\pard\keep\keepn\widctlpar\s2\sb360\sa120\sl276\slmult1\qj\fs32 2.The Cloud and its Services\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj\b\fs28\par
\fs22 What Does it Do?\par
\b0 When people refer to the cloud they are really referring to the internet and storing data, and or accessing services and hardware online, they offer so much in the way of computing services that everything can now be achieved via the Cloud, without the need to buy any expensive equipment or spend ages in setting up services yourself, you can just rent what you need and have it up and running in less than a minute in some cases. There are three main cloud services that are available to end users, \par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\highlight12\b IaaS\par
\cf10\b0 Is Infrastructure as a service,\par
And it is helpful for business and single users in giving them the ability to expand and control their own data infrastructure without having to go out and buy all the equipment necessary. Let us say for example you want to host your own websites and don\rquote t want to buy all the equipment necessary to host a reliable website, or your home internet connection is not the best. By using AWS or Amazon Web Services you have access to all the equipment and software you need to host a website with reliable services a limited downtime.\par
\cf2\b PaaS\par
\cf10\b0 Is Platform as a service,\par
PaaS is a cloud computing service where a third party would provide you with hardware and access to software tools, let us just say that if you wanted to develop some type of application and you didn\rquote t want to buy the hardware and software, or don\rquote t have access to the hardware and software you need, then you could sign up to Google App Engine and access cloud-based services for your application and help you develop it.\par
\cf2\b SaaS\par
\cf10\b0 Is Software as a service,\par
Software as a service is something that might be of interest to you, It is just a way of being able to access software over the internet so you don\rquote t have to go out and buy the whole package, for example, if you only wanted to use a word processing piece of software then you could access google docs over the internet saving you money on stuff you really don\rquote t need when you purchase something like office 365.\par
\line The technology is becoming more advanced and so in the near future we will be seeing a huge improvement in storage capacity for one, as there is becoming a huge demand to be able to store large amounts of data securely and quickly without the need to purchase large storage servers and then the costly venture of setting them up as well, second as the technology of cloud computing advances so will the performance of the internet, as users store more and more data into the cloud the more complex it is and in turn the technology behind serving that data back to customers becomes better and therefore that improvement can be used to improve the internet as a whole. Cloud computing has also given developing countries access to infrastructure and education without the need to invest in expensive equipment to get the services up and running. Cloud computing has also improved our health care system, giving doctors access to patient\rquote s information from a centralized location, eliminating the need for bulky paper work having to be transferred around to each clinic the patient wishes to visit, this then reduces operational costs due to the data being stored in one centralized location giving any medical professional with the clients consent access to his or her data. The cloud is changing the way we use technology and also how we access information.[#3][#4]\cf2\highlight0\b\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj\b0\par
\b What is the Likely Impact?\par
\par
\b0 What is the potential impact of this development?\line With cloud computing becoming more and more popular, data centers will become a huge part of the IT scene leaving a lot of in house jobs redundant. People will be out sourcing their data storage or serving needs to a third party. Also another major impact of cloud computing is giving people a way of reaching everyone, making the internet a much more social place, also giving everyone access to the information they need via a few mouse clicks in turn, making anyone into an instant news reporter, famous screen star, or one of the most dangerous ones an instant doctor.\b [#5]\par
\b0\par
What is likely to change?\par
The most likely thing to change in terms of cloud computing is the adobtion of DaaS which is Desktop as a Service, and that soon there will be no need for business to go out and buy new computer towers, as they will be able to access workstation hardware like we access major infrastructure hardware today. Companies will only have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard, mouse and a basic desktop tower then use the cloud to handle all the compute functions, this way companies can have up to date software no matter what computer the employee is using and with the added advantage of having easy deployment of applications.\b [#6]\par
\par
\cf10\highlight12\b0 Which people will be most affected and how?\par
There will be a lot of in house jobs affected in large companies and even small business  due to the fact that most computing services will be outsourced to a third party. But that will then drive the need for new data centers to be built, or the existing data centers to expand and take on more staff.\par
\cf2\highlight0\par
\b How Will This Affect You?\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\b0 Cloud computing has a huge affect on myself, as I own a small computer repair and general IT shop. I have produced a few websites for clients as well as my own, and when it comes to deploying those websites and deciding whether to spend money on building my own server and hosting them that way, or go with the cloud I choose the cloud, and in particular I had chosen Amazon Web Services for the simple fact that in today's world it makes no sense to spend money on hardware and resources when it can be accessed through the cloud.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1 What will be different for me?\par
My whole business strategy will be changing to accommodate using the cloud and the services it has to offer. Moving all my data onto a reliable and secure server that will have multiple redundant sources if ever one server was to go offline is a great tool for any business which stores a lot of valuable data. With the cost of renting server space and hosting websites and applications from them decreasing, will give me access to a whole new market and bring in additional income.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj How will this affect members of my family or my friends?\par
With everything becoming online and through the cloud will bring its problems to the older members of my family, as things will get complicated quickly for them as the technology changes, but that being said for the younger generation it will be an amazing experience to see what we will be able to do through the cloud in the near future and just how different the internet will be.\par

\pard\keep\keepn\widctlpar\s2\sb360\sa120\sl276\slmult1\qj\fs32 3.Raspberry Pi and Arduino\par

\pard\widctlpar\sl276\slmult1\qj\fs22\par
\b What does it do?\par
\b0 A Raspberry Pi is a small credit card sized, single board computer designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK. Originally designed to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. It plugs into a computer or monitor to provide display. These days, a Raspberry Pi can be used for almost anything you can imagine. People have made everything from audio devices that can play music from spotify all the way up to building their own laptop or phone with a Pi as the main board. The sky's the limit really. Wifi enabled robots that can be controlled via a web browser or a game console controller, home security systems and even real time facial recognition systems have been designed and built with a Raspberry Pi. It can utilize a multitude of operating systems, including multiple Linux distros and Windows 10 IoT Core. It ships with its own linux version, called Raspbian. In its current state, a Raspberry Pi is a computer, and is capable of almost anything a computer can do; with a much lower price point. Newer models boast USB 3.0, ethernet connectivity, and the latest mode can even output to a pair of 4k displays simultaneously. Power is delivered via USB-C to the device. In the future, as hardware gets smaller and more powerful, the Raspberry Pi will be capable of even more. Smarter robots, more robust software and more connectivity with the Internet of Things (IoT). It is a fantastic educational device, and demand is growing for this exciting product. Schools, hobbyists and hospitals have all shown interest over the years. The next model may even be fast enough to replace your basic desktop pc, but memory and storage is still an issue. Arduino is similar to Raspberry Pi in that it is a very small, single board computer with a lot of capability. Arduino boards can read inputs like a button being pressed or light on a sensor and turn that into an output, like a written message, a blinking LED light or even activating a program to post a tweet for instance. They are cheap, and like the Raspberry Pi, it was originally aimed at students with no prior knowledge to be used as a learning device. Everything from a blinking LED light to complex scientific instruments have been created using Arduino boards as the brain of the device. In the future, Arduino hopes to become a much bigger part of the IoT and with a partnership with Intel on the horizon, its cheap prototyping capabilities are going to be even more useful and accessible. An example I've seen was Arduino based home electronics that will allow the user to control the device's functionality in new ways; changing how their microwave heats their food for instance. With easier prototyping, and the modularity of the Arduino, upgrading home electronics or creating your own systems will become much simpler. Some people have already connected an Arduino board to a Raspberry Pi to take advantage of the functionality of both devices to receive inputs from the Arduino and output the results or program to the Raspberry Pi. I can see this functionality getting much better in the next few years as engineers, students and hobbyists keep pushing the limits of these devices. All of this is only possible with the rise of incredibly cheap, and tiny pieces of hardware that are only getting easier and cheaper to produce. These amazing devices have grown exponentially over the last 5 years and now sell millions of units per year, further funding development to improve and upgrade the hardware.\par
\par
\b What is the likely impact?\par
\b0 The impact of these devices can not be understated. While both were originally designed as learning tools for students with little to no experience, the modularity of the devices and ability to execute many custom programs has drawn interest from many other sectors, including restaurants, hospitals, government bodies and universities. These devices will be the brains of the next generation of IoT devices, and as such will become a part of many people's daily lives. Having cheaper, easily upgradeable hardware could make ordering food at a restaurant as simple as using a touchscreen menu and having the chef directly receive your order. As automation becomes more commonplace, there will be less face to face interaction and more simple computer systems running everything from the lights in a restaurant, to keeping track of a hospital patients treatment records. As these devices get cheaper and more powerful, and more people with experience decide to go into teaching as a career, expect these devices to be everywhere; classrooms, homes, schools, hospitals and businesses are all in a great position to take advantage of the this technology. The Internet of Things keeps growing, and these simple, powerful devices are leading the way to an interesting new world of automation and computing.\par
\par
These devices could make many simple, easily programmable jobs completely redundant, which has always been a concern of automation critics. We see this already, with places like McDonalds taking most in store orders through automated systems that require no employee interaction. Automation isn't to be feared though, society is changing, and we as humans need to change and adapt with it, or be left in the past. Something to be concerned about is our digital privacy, and data protection. While these devices can be used to protect you, they are also another potential entry point for malicious users to attempt to subvert our systems and steal our data.\par
\par
\b How will this affect me?\par
\b0 These devices could have a multitude of effects on me. As someone interested in emerging\par
technologies, I want to see how I can use devices like this in my own life; whether I want to embark on various Raspberry Pi projects to connect to the Internet of Things all the way to building my daughter a simple word processing laptops. Many of my friends and family will be affected by this technology as well. Jobs may become obsolete, or easier. Keeping our homes and private data secure is becoming increasingly difficult, and these devices can either help or harm our attempts at digital privacy.Several people in my family use simple electronics in their work, and these cheap devices could make their jobs easier to manage, while raising productivity. Having a fully connected home can make simple daily tasks simpler or easier to keep track of, but a power outage or an internet connectivity issue could see us losing control of our homes. With everyone in the modern world is becoming more interested in the power of home computing and connectivity, education about these devices and necessary security when going online is more important than ever. With a home connected and run by these devices, the risk of personal and private information being stolen by nefarious parties becomes even more likely. But these devices can also help secure our information, using programs and firewalls outside of our usual computer based protections. Digital privacy should be everyone's concern in this day and age, And these devices are both a boon and a menace when it comes that protecting ourselves online.\b [#@Kyle Hudson]\b0\par
