	</br>Doug Barrett- Cyber Security
	Matt Wilson- Web Application Development<br />
	Sean Cullen- Web Application Development<br />
	John- Software Development<br />
	Kyle Hudson- Network Engineer<br />
	<br />
	<b>Compare and Contrast the Ideal Jobs for Each Person in the Group<br /></b>
	There is a variety of roles within the group which some are the same and some are different. Matt and I being Sean want to do Web Application Development. Doug’s ideal job is Cyber Security, Johns is Software Development and Kyles is Network Engineer. The common elements between Cyber Security, Software Development, Network Engineering and Web Application Development all use programming and require analytical skills. Network engineers also need programming skills to use the new tools and the new programmatic access. But the requirements of network engineering and the job market are now requiring more network engineers with programming skills and a broader and deeper understanding of programming along with analytical skills.(Anon, 2020)
	As a web developer, you'll need to understand the basics of coding and mark-up language, JavaScript. As you master HTML and CSS, eventually you'll want to learn JavaScript, Photoshop, WordPress, Analytical Skills, SEO and Responsive Design.
	(Classifieds.usatoday.com, 2020)<br />
	<b>The common elements that these roles is the use of programming and analytical skills. What differentiates the roles are: <br /></b>
	<b>Cyber Security: </b><br />is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware. (Kaspersky.com.au, 2020)
	<b>Software development:</b> is an iterative logical process that aims to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a unique business or personal objective, goal or process. Software development is generally a planned initiative that consists of various steps or stages that result in the creation of operational software. Software development is primarily achieved through computer programming, which is carried out by a software programmer and includes processes such as initial research, data flow design, process flow design, flow charts, technical documentation, software testing, debugging and other software architecture techniques. This is known as the software development life cycle (SDLC).
	(Techopedia.com, 2020)<br />
	<b>Web Application Development:</b><br /> Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the user’s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. Most web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML5. Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small development team. Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side programming. Client refers to a computer application such as a web browser. Client-side programming will typically utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML programming will instruct a browser how to display the on-screen content of web pages, while CSS keeps displayed information in the correct format. JavaScript will run JavaScript code on a web page, making some of the content interactive. Server-side programming powers the client-side programming and is used to create the scripts that web applications use. Scripts can be written in multiple scripting languages such as Ruby, Java and Python. Server-side scripting will create a custom interface for the end-user and will hide the source code that makes up the interface.
	(SearchCloudComputing, 2020)<br />
	<b>Network Engineer: </b><br />focuses on delivering high-availability network infrastructure to sustain the online and on-site information technology activities of users. Network engineers often overlap with other roles, such as computer network architects or security systems engineers, and work internally within an organization or as outside consultants. Network engineers design and implement network configurations, troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and configure security systems such as firewalls. They often report to a CIO, chief information security officer and other line-of-business leaders to discuss and decide upon overall business goals, policies and network status updates. In many situations, network engineers work closely with project managers and other engineers, manage capacity and carry out remote or on-site support.
	(SearchNetworking, 2020)<br />
	The career plans for Myself (Sean) and Matt will be similar, Doug, Kyle and Johns career plans will be quite different as they have different IT job roles they want to pursue. Researching each job's role programming came into all of them as well as analytical skills
