Assessment details 

My profile 
Purpose 
Now that you have developed a profile of yourself (Assignment 1), it is time to use this profile to assemble a group, and to show how you can work as a team to produce a report on various aspects of the IT industry. 
What you will demonstrate: 
You’ll demonstrate your ability to work in a team environment, complete research tasks, and to present information in a professional report format. You’ll also explore your creative side by putting forward a group project idea expanding or combining project ideas from Assignment 1 which can be bolstered by your research into your chosen IT Technologies. 
How you will demonstrate it: 
Writing up a document covering all of the different areas listed above (and detailed below), to be then formatted and presented in a PDF Report. Present a group website hosted on GitHub Pages. 
Specifications 

Team profile 

Each of you will have produced a personal profile for Assignment 1. You are to assemble this information, reviewing it as you see fit given your feedback from Assignment 1, to produce a team profile. This should be organised into the following subsections. 

Team Name 

You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this name will be used to identify your group for the rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that this name could be one that comes to the attention of potential employers. 

Personal information 

One paragraph per person, including name, student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and IT experience. This should also include your team’s chosen name. 

Team Profile 

The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later. 

Ideal Jobs 

Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group? 

Tools 

Having set up an individual website in Assignment 1, you should now set up a group website, using the same approach. You should then include links to each individual website on the group website. 
You also need to set up a GitHub or similar repository for your group on which you can use Git. This is to facilitate the production and maintenance of group artefacts, which will include the assignment submission, but may also include other reports or information, code, examples, formatted data, images and videos, links, and similar information. 
You will also need to set up your group on Canvas. 
In your report you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following: 
• The link to your group’s website 
• The link to your group’s Git repository (GitHub, BitBucket, etc) 
• Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission. 

Industry Data 

In Canvas, you will find a link to some industry data supplied by Burning Glass. You should use this (as well as any other data you may be able to find) to answer the following questions. 
• What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? 
• From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc). 
o How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand 
from employers? o How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand 
from employers? o What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your 
required skill set? o What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? 
• Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? 

IT Work 

The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work. There are two ways in which you can do this, as below. 
• Interview an IT professional 
• View, summarise and discuss at least 10 YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how many hits there are for a Google search on A day in the life of an IT professional). 
You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a group) interview an IT professional. Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that you will find helpful in the future. If you choose this option, you will be provided with a list of 
questions to ask and some basic training in how to go about this interview. If you choose the web sources option, you need to report on 5 different IT professionals, as well as indicate your 10 sources. 
Whichever source of information you use, you should answer the following questions. 
• What kind of work is done by the IT professional? 
• What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? 
• Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? 
• What aspect of their position is most challenging? \

IT Technologies 

There are a lot of fascinating developments going on in the IT world, many of which may fall by the wayside, but some of which are likely to change the way the world works. Historic examples of such developments include the Internet, smartphones, cloud computing and public-key cryptography. 
In this section you should report on 4 of the areas below. 
• Clouds, services, servers 
• Cybersecurity 
• Blockchain and cryptocurrencies 
• Machine Learning 
• Autonomous vehicles 
• Natural Language processing and chatterbots 
• Robots 
• Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices 
Some starting points and other information will be made available on Canvas. 
For each of the areas covered, you should report on the following. 
What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible? 
What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? 
How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? 

Project Ideas 

You all have some project ideas that you reported in Assignment 1. You are to come up with a project idea for the group as a whole, which could be an individual’s idea, but is more likely to be a combination of each of the ideas you had individually, together with comments and feedback from your Assignment 1 marker, instructor, and anyone else who you would like to consult. 
You may also wish to consider what problems need to be solved, for which there are many sources of information, such as the ones below. There are many more websites like these, of course. 
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-are-the-10-biggest-global-challenges/ 
https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/want-to-be-a-billionaire-solve-one-of- these-5-problems.html/?a=viewall 
https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-problems-that-need-solving 
There is no set length for this section, but it is difficult to see how a description of less than 500 words would be adequate. Do not limit yourself to this if you have more than this to write, though - but it should be in a well written and concise format. If you are unsure of how much to write, ask your instructor for advice. 

Feedback 

By the time you get to Week 8, you should have been working as a group for three weeks, and hence have some experience of how well the group is working. A key feature of industry teams is the ability to give and receive feedback, particular to members of a team in which you are working. In order to give you some experience at this, your group should login to the SparkPLUS tool (instructions on how to do this 
Referencing guidelines

You must acknowledge all the courses of information you have used in your assessments. 
will be given on Canvas). Each person should provide an assessment of each member of the group, including themselves. This will then provide feedback to each of you, and in particular, on how the rest of the team view’s your performance. 
You do not need to include any information about the feedback you receive, as this is intended to give you experience with use of tools such as these, and how the information is gathered and processed in such tools. The markers will, however, check that each person in the group has contributed via SparkPLUS, and the marks for this section will only be awarded if all group members have contributed in an appropriate manner by the assignment deadline. 
If you have any concerns with this process, please raise these with your tutor or lecturer. In particular, if you wish to have a group discussion about this feedback, please contact the lecturer who will facilitate a group discussion on this topic. 

Group Reflection 

Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in this assignment. You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes (such as commit trails from GitHub, or project meeting minutes). Each member of the group should contribute up to 200 words about their own perception of the group, and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words. This should include the following attributes. 
• What went well 
• What could be improved 
• At least one thing that was surprising 
• At least one thing that you have learned about groups 
• Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.
