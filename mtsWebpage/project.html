											<h2>META Foods</h2>
											<p>Convenient and healthy living, a focus on more than just food.</p>
										</header>
										<hr>
										<h3><strong>What is META Foods?</strong> &nbsp A quick overview.</h3>
										<p>"A focus on more than just food" is what META Foods is all about. Today, more than ever we are scraping for more minutes in the day 
                                            after work and before bed to spend more time with our families and decompress. While many of us, myself included, find cooking very
											relaxing and fulfilling, often it is the last thing we want to do at the end of what was potentially a long day. This feeling of "I have to cook tonight"
											is no doubt heightened when it's a mammoth task to find something everyone in your house will not only eat, but will nourish and sustain them.</br></br>
											This is where META Foods comes into the picture, providing everyone from all walks of life a means of easily having affordable, delicious and healthy meals 
											every night of the week.</BR>
											The cooking is still up to you (we aren't quite there yet) but we have taken care of doing all of the thinking for you when it comes to meeting your entire families
											dietary requirements, health goals and taking grocery shopping out of the equation while still supporting your local supermarkets.</br></br>
											<hr>
											
                                            <h3><strong>The who and the why.</strong>&nbsp  Our Motivation.</h3>											
										   We are all fathers, brothers or son's and some of us have fairly strict dietary requirements and a desire to try and eat healthy
										   along with family members or friends who potentially need a large variety of different food to help their growth and developement. We believe there is a gap in 
										   the market where convenient, affordable and accessible meals are concerned.  </br></br>
										   When it comes to easily meeting the "food needs" of a family or yourself this is especially true with busy lives involving work,
										   hobbies and family. Services like "Hello Fresh" and "Dinnerly" seek to streamline the process of finding a recipe, grocery shopping, 
										   food preperation and cooking. They do succeed with making this easier but they do not allow for a lot of variation to meet different needs within
										   a single order and (at least for me peronsally) these are not financially lucrative for a whole family.</br></br>
										   This application seeks to take food from an idea to your plate using local super markets and good old fasioned family cooking combined with
										   industry knowledge to bring you something affordable, delicious and healthy that you have tailor made for your situation.</br></br></br>
                                           <hr>
										   <h3><strong>The how and the now.</strong>&nbsp  A description.</h3>	
                                           Imagine you are about to go grocery shopping, but you have no idea where to even start 
										   because your partner cannot eat gluten and requires iron-rich meals, your eldest is vegetarian and lactose intolerant
										   and you are trying to cut back on carbs while attempting to cater for everyone elseâ€™s needs and still enjoy your food.
										   The first and most obvious thought is that you will need to shop for three people individually.</br></br>
										 
										   										   
										   This application will endeavour to allow users to easily generate recipes and meal plans for any number of days based on dietary requirements,
										   weight goals and gym goals. The GUI will essentially provide a means to use specific filters (most are briefly mentioned below) to provide the user 
                                           with a list of recipes, all with methods and cooking instructions that will allow for the creation of meals and snacks.
										   
										   All of this will be done from the ease of any computer or smart device as META Foods has been developed as a web-based
										   application allowing ease of access and focusing on a user centred design philosophy.</br></br>
